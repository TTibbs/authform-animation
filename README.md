# Animated Auth Form
This project is a simple yet elegant implementation of user authentication using Firebase. The application features an animated sign-up and sign-in form that provides a seamless user experience. The primary goal of this project is to explore the integration of Firebase Authentication into a frontend application, focusing on best practices for user management, security, and UI design.

## Features
- Firebase Integration: Fully integrated with Firebase for user authentication, leveraging Firebase's powerful and secure backend services.
- Animated UI: Smooth, responsive animations enhance the user experience during the sign-up and sign-in processes.
- Form Validation: Client-side form validation ensures that users provide valid information before submission.
- User Sessions: Persistent user sessions that keep users logged in even after a page refresh or application restart.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend:

- Vite: Ultra-fast frontend tooling for building modern web applications.
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development and custom styling.
- JavaScript/React (if applicable): For building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

### Backend:

- Firebase Authentication: Manages user sign-up, sign-in, and session persistence.

### Development Tools:

- Visual Studio Code: The primary code editor for development.
- Git: Version control for managing codebase changes.
- Firebase CLI: Command-line interface for deploying and managing Firebase projects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js
- npm
- Firebase CLI
- Git

### Installation
Clone the Repository:
```bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/authform-animation.git
cd animated-auth-form
```

### Install Dependencies:
```bash
Copy code
npm install
```

### Set Up Firebase:
- Create a new project in the Firebase Console.
- Enable Firebase Authentication and choose your preferred sign-in methods (e.g., Email/Password).
- Copy the Firebase configuration object from your Firebase project settings.
- Create a .env file in the root directory and add your Firebase configuration:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
```

### Run the Application:
```bash
Copy code
npm run dev
```

The app should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

## Usage

Open the application in your browser.
Use the sign-up form to create a new account, or sign in with an existing account.
Upon successful authentication, users will be directed to the dashboard (or a similar protected area of the app).
